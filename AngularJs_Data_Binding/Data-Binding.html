<!-- The ng-model directive provides a two-way binding between the model and the view.

Two-way Binding
Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view.

When data in the model changes, the view reflects the change, and 
when data in the view changes, the model is updated as well. 
This happens immediately and automatically, 
which makes sure that the model and the view is updated at all times. -->

<body>

    <!-- <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
        Name: <input ng-model="firstname">
        <h1>{{firstname}}</h1>
    </div>

    <script>
        var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
        app.controller('myCtrl', function ($scope) {
            $scope.firstname = "John";
            $scope.lastname = "Doe";
        });
    </script>

    <p>Change the name inside the input field, and the model data will change automatically, and therefore also the
        header will change its value.</p> -->

    <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
        <h1 ng-click="changeName()">{{firstname}}</h1>
    </div>

    <script>
        var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
        app.controller('myCtrl', function ($scope) {
            $scope.firstname = "John";
            $scope.changeName = function () {
                $scope.firstname = "Nelly";
            }
        });
    </script>

    <p>Click on the header to run the "changeName" function.</p>

    <p>This example demonstrates how to use the controller to change model data.</p>
